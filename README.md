# üîêüçå Banana Security: Authentication App ‚Äì NOVI Frontend Module

This repository contains my solution for the **Banana Security Authentication Application** assignment from the Frontend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).  
The goal of this project is to practice **React Context**, **state management**, **React Router**, and **protected routes** by building a secure platform where users can register, sign in, and access a protected profile page.

## Key Features

    1. **Home** (`/`)
    2. **Profile** (`/profile`) ‚Äì protected route, only accessible when logged in
    3. **Sign In** (`/signin`)
    4. **Sign Up** (`/signup`)

- **Navigation bar** that dynamically updates:
    - Shows **Login** and **Register** when logged out.
    - Shows **Logout** when logged in.

- Authentication state is managed globally with **React Context**.
- `login` function:
    - Updates auth state to `true`.
    - Redirects the user to the **Profile page**.

    - Updates auth state to `false`.
    - Redirects the user to the **Home page**.
